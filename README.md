Got it üëç
If you want to test **Amazon Macie** on an S3 bucket, you‚Äôll need some **synthetic sensitive data**. This lets Macie detect things like PII (Personally Identifiable Information), financial data, or credentials. Here are a few safe examples you can upload to your bucket:

---

## üìÇ Sample Sensitive Data File (synthetic)

Save this as `sensitive-data-sample.txt` and upload it to your bucket:

```
Name: John Doe
Email: john.doe@example.com
Phone: +1-202-555-0198
Address: 1234 Elm Street, Springfield, IL 62704, USA
SSN: 123-45-6789
Credit Card: 4111 1111 1111 1111
Bank Account: 9876543210
Routing Number: 021000021

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Use with Macie

1. **Create/Select an S3 Bucket**
   Example: `s3://macie-sensitive-data-demo`

   ```bash
   aws s3 mb s3://macie-sensitive-data-demo
   ```

2. **Upload the test file**

   ```bash
   aws s3 cp sensitive-data-sample.txt s3://macie-sensitive-data-demo/
   ```

3. **Enable Amazon Macie**

   ```bash
   aws macie2 enable-macie --status ENABLED
   ```

4. **Create a Classification Job**

   ```bash
   aws macie2 create-classification-job \
     --job-type ONE_TIME \
     --name "macie-pii-test-job" \
     --s3-job-definition bucketDefinitions=[{accountId=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text),buckets=["macie-sensitive-data-demo"]}]
   ```

5. **View Findings**
   After the scan, go to **Macie Console ‚Üí Findings** and you should see alerts for **PII, credentials, and financial data**.

---

‚úÖ This data is **synthetic** (not real), but matches the **patterns Macie looks for** (SSNs, credit cards, phone numbers, etc.).
You can expand it with fake healthcare IDs, PAN numbers (India), or custom regex patterns if you want Macie to detect region-specific sensitive info.

Do you also want me to create a **Terraform/IaC module** that provisions the bucket, uploads the sample file, and enables Macie automatically?
